# S/R Strategies

For all strategies, finding multiple confluences is a great way to increase the chances of a successful trade. I will often layer Fibonacci and Volume Profile levels over the S/R levels. Look for places where the different approaches point to the same price range and trade these areas of high confluence more confidently and with greater size.

:::note
 Here the bounce happened at an S/R level, in the fib golden zone ( .5 to .618 ) and at the bottom of a volume profile node.

## Support Becomes Resistance (SBR)

This is one of the most successful strategies leveraging the indicator levels and works in both the Long and Short directions. The typical trade involves identifying a critical level (one where consolidating has happened at that level before breaking). Scaling in as price approaches the level and having a stop under (or over depending on the direction of the trade) the level. This creates a good risk to reward ratio. 

* Find an area of strong reaction where price jumps away from a level.
* Finding more than one reaction increases the likelihood of that level being defended.
* Wait for the level to be breached.
* Wait for the price to retest this level and take the trade in the direction of the initial break.
* Can be applied to all timeframes but 5 and 30 minutes works well for intraday.

## GAP Rejection (GR)

* Gaps like to be filled but they also often act as resistance before getting filled.
* Gaps can be treated as strong resistance / support for reversal plays.

## GAP Close Reversal (GCR)

* Once a GAP is closed you will often see at least a scalp-able reversal happen. This is especially true if it takes several days to close the gap.

## DPOC Bounces (DPOCB)

* The DPOC often acts as a strong support / resistance level and can be played as a bounce spot.
* Representing the highest volume node over the last X days this area represents where most of the shares have been traded.

## Final Stand (FS)

* This setup involves a level which has been tested many times. If it finally breaks through you can take a trade in the direction of the break with a tight stop above the level.
* This setup is better if there is an additional confluence, in the picture below there was a head and shoulders pattern forming.
* This setup can also be played as a `Support Becomes Resistance` play by waiting for a retest instead of playing the break directly.

## Bounce And Pop (BAP)

* This setup involves a level which has been tested, rejects and then pushes back through. 
* These tend to continue up or down to the next critical level and will often have a decent push following the level break.

## Failed Breakdown / Breakout (FB)

* This setup involves a level which has been tested and bounced. Often there will be another push above or below to trap traders before reversing hard. 
* Enter once price crosses above the high of the breakdown bar or crosses below the low of the breakout bar and ride to the next level.
