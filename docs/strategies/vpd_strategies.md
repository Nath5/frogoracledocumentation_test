# VPD Strategies

## Volume Accumulation Setup [VAS]

Use range based profile over the consolidation range. Find the highest volume nodes and watch for a retest of those nodes or the POC to take a trade in the direction of the trend.

## Volume Trend Setup [VT]

In a trending market, one where the price action is moving up or down smoothly. Use the volume profile over the trending area to identify areas of denser volume. Use these areas for support / resistance and trade them for a bounce. It is ideal to use VT in combination with other setups, like 'Support Becomes Resistance' using the S/R indicator.
